# David Yu's Tic Tac Toe

The overall objective is to implement a proof-of-concept Tic Tac Toe game using React + TypeScript that allows a player to play either against another player or against a computer opponent. The game is played on a 3 X 3 grid and supports two game modes - standard and wild.
